solution : Go to the ```android/``` directory of the ```react-native project``` then create a file called ```local.properties``` write code \
in Windows ```sdk.dir = C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk``` \
in macOS ```sdk.dir = /Users/USERNAME/Library/Android/sdk``` \
in linux ```sdk.dir = /home/USERNAME/Android/Sdk```
